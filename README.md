# Compress Image
Image processing, and in particular image resizing, is a common requirement for web applications. 

In the project there're 3 functions that use different libraries with .NET Core to process images. You can set quality, size and Image file formats. 

Are they:

* [CoreCompat.System.Drawing](https://github.com/CoreCompat/CoreCompat);
* [Image Sharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp);
* [Magic Scaler](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PhotoSauce.MagicScaler/0.7.0-alpha);
